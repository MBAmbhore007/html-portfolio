<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Everyone, <br> It's your beloved friend 'Mayur Ambhore'</p>

<p>“I like living in my head because in there, everyone is kind and 
  innocent. Once you start integrating yourself into the world, you realize that people are nasty, mean creatures.<br> They're worse than zombies. People try to crush your soul and destroy your happiness, 
  but zombies just want to have a little nibble of your brain.” <br> <br>
  Always be yourself. At the end of the day, that’s all you’ve really got; when you strip everything down, that’s all you’ve got, so always be yourself.
